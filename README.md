# Aerostack2

Aerostack2 is a framework developed to fly aerial platforms using ROS2.

![Build for Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS galactic](https://github.com/aerostack2-developers/aerostack2/actions/workflows/build-galactic.yml/bagde.svg)

Most important features:
- Natively developed on ROS2
- Complete modularity, allowing elements to be changed or interchanged without affecting the rest of the system
- Independence of the aerial platform.
- Project-oriented, allowing to install and use only the necessary packages for the application to be developed. 
- Swarming orientation.
